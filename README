This repository contains the software I wrote for ELEN90066 Embedded System Design, Semester 2 2014.

This runs on an Atmega16.
Peripherals:
	- FM25L16B 16K-bit Serial FRAM
	- EA DOGS102W-6 Graphic LCD with SPI interface
	- 74AHC30 8 input NAND gate
	- Red and green LEDs
	- SC120 Boost regulator for powering the system
	- 9 tact switches for user input
	- (optional) potentiometer input using the Atmegas internal ADC
